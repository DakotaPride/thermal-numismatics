## Inputs

The first input of the recipe is what you are trading/selling for an output.<br>In the provided example recipe, this item is an Emerald.<br><br>The second input, underneath the first slot, is where you can choose to place a matching catalyst. This is controlled via an item tag - "thermalnumismatics:trade_station/allowed_catalysts"
- You are <strong>required</strong> to have your "catalyst" item in this item tag, otherwise it will be consumed. Of course, if you wish for it to be consumed upon usage, feel free to ignore this item tag.

## Outputs

There is currently only one output slot, of which will provide you items or currency depending on what recipes you create.

## Other Notes

This mod is designed to go alongside KubeJS or other mod that can add or remove recipes, specifically in modpacks.<br>Aside from the example recipe, this mod does not add any recipes by itself and requires you to create your own recipes with the trade station.<br><br>Once you are ready to create your recipes or have already created your recipes, feel free to delete the example recipe provided.
